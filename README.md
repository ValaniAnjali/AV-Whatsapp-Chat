I recently built a basic WhatsApp-like app featuring:

📝 Signup/Sign-in functionality

💬 One-on-one chat capability

🌐 Google Sign-In integration

This project was a way for me to dive into the basics of Firebase, including:

Firebase Authentication for managing users.

Firebase Realtime Database for storing and syncing messages.

💡 Acknowledgment
I took inspiration and guidance from various tutorials and references to better understand the implementation.
I'm truly grateful for the amazing resources available in the developer community that helped me grasp these concepts and apply them practically. 🙏

🌟 Why This Project?
